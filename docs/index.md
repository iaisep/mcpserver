# MCP-Odoo Documentation

Welcome to the MCP-Odoo documentation. This guide will help you understand, implement, and extend the MCP-Odoo connector, which provides a bridge between Odoo ERP systems and AI agents using the Model Context Protocol.

## Overview

MCP-Odoo enables AI agents to access and manipulate Odoo data through a standardized interface. It exposes accounting data, partner information, and other Odoo resources to AI agents via the Model Context Protocol, allowing conversational and automated interaction with ERP data.
